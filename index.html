    <h2> Short Biography </h2>
<p class="Biography"> I was born in Africa and immigrated to the U.S when I was 7 years ago. I became very interested in coding when I was
    a young adult in high school. I stayed interested in coding and vowed I would learn it someday. The summer of 2022 I finally got 
    an opportunity. </p>

    <p> I graduated from Kirkwood Community College through the infamous pandemic, in 2020 with an associates of applied sciences in medical assisting.
        For the last 1.5 years i've been gaining experience in the healthcare field. My goal is to eventually procure a job in software engineering that could also
